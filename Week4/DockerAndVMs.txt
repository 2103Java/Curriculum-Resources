Before VM: 
	Have all our apps running on a bare metal server. Difficult to manage
	how much resource our application consume. We get another server, to run 
	seperate applications. Costly and slow. 

What is a VM?
	Virtual Machines are virtulized at the hardware level. 
	The Hypervisor is what manages the seperation between the hardware
	and the virtual machine. 
	We can have a seperate OS in our VM. 
	
Why do want VM?
	We get isolated environments, if a single VM fails then none of the 
	other VMs are affected (barring hardware failure).
	We can have different environemnts for testing, deploying, produciton. 
	All inside the same machine. 

	VMs allow us to restrict how much system an app can "see", 

	Simulated computer inside my computer.
	(It's simulated because I can change the hardrive, with a number)



What are containers?
	VMs can be viewed as hardware virtulization. 
	Container can be viewed as OS virtualization. 

	Containers can be used within virtual machines. 

	>Much smaller in size compared to VM (megabytes compared to gigabytes)
		(allows quicker boot up time)
	> Much more portable than VMs because they share the same OS as the host machine. 
	> There is less management overhead because they share the same OS.
